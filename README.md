# Kettle
React Native and Firebase app.

# Idea:
This is going to be a cross-platform application (Web, iOS, Android) applicatoin that has a simple text dumpe function.

# Features
- The idea is to be login-free and as fast as possible to use. Using Firebase, you can dump in text in your unique Kettle and be able to access that anywhere just by searching the Kettle ID.
- Realtime Syncing
- "Star" feature to have the app default to your preferred Kettle
- Side drawer menu with the ability to navigate to a different Kettle (by typing in the Kettle ID (kID) or create a new Kettle

# Down the road
Being able to share (email, text or copy) the link to the Kettle that you are in to make it easy for people to access.

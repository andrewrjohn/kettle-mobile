# Kettle
React Native/Firebase supprted

This is going to be a cross-platform application (Web, iOS, Android) application that has a simple text dump function.

# Features
- The idea is to be login-free and as fast as possible to use. Using Firebase, you can dump text into your unique Kettle and be able to access that anywhere just by searching the Kettle ID.
- Realtime Syncing, no refreshing or reloading.
- "Star" feature to have the app default to your preferred Kettle
- Side drawer menu with the ability to navigate to a different Kettle (by typing in the Kettle ID (kID) or create a new Kettle

# Down the road
Being able to share (email, text or copy) the link to the Kettle that you are in to make it easy for people to access.
Image/video upload.

# Why?
Mainly to learn React Native and Firebase

ALSO,
I have run into instances when I wanted to get some text or media on my computer to my phone (or vice versa), and having to email it to myself is clunky and frustrating.
